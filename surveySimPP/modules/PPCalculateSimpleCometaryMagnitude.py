    Description: This task calculates the brightness of the comet at a given pointing
    according to a simple model by A'Hearn et al. (1984).
    
    The brightness is here calculated in the main filter, and the colour offset is
    applied later using the PPhookBrightnessWithColour function.
    
    Mandatory input:      string, padain, name of input pandas daraframe   
                          string, mainfilter, name of the main filter in which
                                  the brightness is calculated

    Output:
