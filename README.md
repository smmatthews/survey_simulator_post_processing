# survey_simulator_post_processing

<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dirac-institute/survey_simulator_post_processing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dirac-institute/survey_simulator_post_processing) -->

![pytest](https://github.com/dirac-institute/survey_simulator_post_processing/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg)

LSST stack based post-processing modules in python for the JPL survey simulator: https://github.com/AsteroidSurveySimulator/objectsInField

Currently tested with the following fork: https://github.com/eggls6/objectsInField

Currently requires latest development version of sbpy: https://github.com/NASA-Planetary-Science/sbpy.git

Documentation: https://survey-simulator-post-processing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## developer best practices
* Data sets should be moved to the `data` folder, have a readme.txt or readme.md to explain where the data came from as well as a time stamp in the readme.txt.
* Data sets that are used for unit testing should live in `data/test`.  
* All required input files for the main software or unit tests should have extensions that clearly describe the file format (e.g. .csv, .txt, .db, .fits)
* Function/methods names should follow Rubin / LSST developer guide conventions: https://developer.lsst.io/
* If you are working on addressing a specific issue ticket, assign yourself the ticket and set the status to "in progress"
* When making a pull request that closes an issue, cite the issue ticket in the pull request summary

## Installation
Set up a conda environment and activate:
```
conda create -n survey_sim_pp python=3.8 pip
conda activate survey_sim_pp
```

Download the repo and cd into the directory:
```
cd ~/survey_simulator_post_processing
```

The code can be installed by typing:
```
pip install -e .
```

Then it can be run via:
```
surveySimPP -c ./PPConfig.ini -l ./data/test/testcolour.txt -o ./data/test/testorb.des -p ./data/test/oiftestoutput.txt 
```


## Collaboration
This effort is a collaboration between the University of Washington's DIRAC Institute, Queen's University Belfast, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
